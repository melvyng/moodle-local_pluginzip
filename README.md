# moodle-local_pluginzip
Plugin ZIP Exporter allows administrators to download installed Moodle plugins as ZIP files directly from the Moodle interface.  The plugin provides a simple interface to select a plugin type (mod, etc), choose an installed plugin, and export its source code as a ZIP archive. This is useful for backup, migration, auditing, or development purposes.
